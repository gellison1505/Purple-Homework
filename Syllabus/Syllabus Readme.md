**Instructions**

This assignment will help you get practice with HTML and a bit of CSS. An HTML template (HW1.html) has been provided to help you get started.

Challenge: Make an HTML version of <span style="font-family:Courier;">Course Syllabus.pdf.</span> Text for the assignment can cut and pasted from <span style="font-family:Courier;">Course Syllabus.txt.</span>

Do not attempt to make your syllabus match the example exactly. Instead, experiment with fonts, colors, weights, and alignment to achieve an equally professional look.

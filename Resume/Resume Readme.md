### Instructions

This assignment will help you get practice with HTML and some CSS as well.  A little extra HTML/CSS research will be required
as indicated in the directions.

**5 points** CSS Challenge: Modify `resume.html`so that it looks like [resume-target.png](resume-target.png).

Refer to [resume-specifications.png](resume-specifications.png) for exact requirements.  Note that the entire content of the page should be a width of 960px, and that the page should be centered on your screen.

HINT: You will need to research how to specify fonts in CSS, as well as how the `margin` property can be used to center the entire page on the screen.

ANOTHER HINT: You only need to add CSS code inside the `<style>...</style>` element. No other HTML changes should be necessary.

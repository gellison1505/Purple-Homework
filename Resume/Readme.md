**5 points** Challenge: Create a file named `resume.html` and code it to match [resume-target.png](resume-target.png).

Refer to [resume-specifications.png](resume-specifications.png) for exact requirements.  Note that the entire content of the page should be a width of 960px, and that the page should be centered on your screen.

HINT: You will need to research how to specify fonts in CSS, as well as how the `margin` property can be used to center the entire page on the screen.

You also may want to research the `float` property to position the image on your page.

In this assignment you will complete an application that shuffles and deals cards using Javascript/JQuery and HTML. `Deal a Hand.pdf` shows what the application looks like.

The pdf shows a 5-card hand. When you have successfully completed the application, clicking the link above the hand will display 5 new randomly selected cards.

Instructions

* Read `cards.html` and `cards.js.`
* Update `cards.js` to respond to a mouse click event that starts the deal of a new hand.
* Determine the filename of each card that should be displayed in the new hand.
* Replace the current card images with the images of the new hand.

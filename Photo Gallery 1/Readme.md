### Instructions

This assignment will help you practice laying out a gallery of pictures using HTML tags and the CSS flexbox model.

Take a look at Photo Gallery 1.pdf.       

* Four JPG images of a dog named `Noble` have been provided for you to display in your gallery. Copy the pictures to a subfolder below the folder where your `.html` file is located.
* Create an external stylesheet and use CSS and flexbox to match [photo-gallery-specs.pdf](photo-gallery-specs.pdf).
* Display the pictures in two columns.
* Use at least three different border styles to frame each picture.
* You are encouraged to learn additional CSS techniques to help you complete the assignment.
* Try to come as close as possible the pdf example.
